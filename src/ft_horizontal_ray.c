	This function do ray cast math. Again, for more information please check:
	https://lodev.org/cgtutor/raycasting.html

	We use this function to draw the walls and sprites acccording to the angle
	of the players view.

	First we calculate the angle of the ray. We add 30 to the player's angle
	because we want to draw 60 degree view. Then we calculate the vertical
	and horizontal ray's distance. We use the distance to draw the walls
	and sprites. We also use the distance to fix the fisheye effect.
	We also use the distance to calculate the height of the walls and sprites.
	
	While i is less than WIDTH we draw the walls and sprites. With the help of
	ft_vertical_ray and ft_horizontal_ray functions we calculate where the
	ray is crossing first time with horizontal or the vertical line.

	This function is used to fix fish eye effect:
		db->dist = db->dist * cos(ft_degree_to_radian
			(angle_to_360(db->pa - ray->ra)));
	
	If we look right or left, we take vertical ray's Y position:
		db->ray = (int)(ray->vy) % 64;
	
	Else, we take horizontal ray's X position:
		db->ray = (int)(ray->vx) % 64;
	
	With line_draw function we draw the walls and doors.
	With sprite_draw function we draw the sprites.
	Finally, we reset the ray's angle and increase i.
